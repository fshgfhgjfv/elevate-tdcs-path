            "A. Vulnerability: XSS. Fix: escape output.",

          correctAnswer: "B",

          question: "A web app accepts serialized objects from clients, deserializes them directly, and later executes methods on objects. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload that, when deserialized, triggers arbitrary code execution on the server. Which mitigation(s) best reduce this risk?",
          options: [
            "A. Accept and deserialize only from authenticated clients.",
            "B. Switch to a different serialization format (e.g., JSON) and validate inputs; implement strict allowlists for types during deserialization; run the app with least privilege and sandboxing.",

            "D. Increase server logging and alerting for suspicious activity."
          ],
          correctAnswer: "B",
          explanation: "Safest approach: avoid unsafe native deserialization; prefer safer formats (JSON) or use frameworks that restrict types; implement type allowlists during deserialization; run with minimal privileges and sandbox critical functionality. Transport encryption (C) and logging (D) help but don't prevent exploitation; (A) isn't sufficient because authenticated clients can still send malicious payloads."
